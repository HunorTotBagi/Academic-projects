This project was conducted as part of the "Large Scale Data Mining" course during my Master's studies. 

It was undertaken as part of the sbv IMPROVER project, which aims to explore the diagnostic potential of metagenomics data in the discrimination of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The primary objective of the challenge was classification, however, the focus of this project was the performance evaluation of various Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction of the data prior to classification. The results of this study can be found in the project write-up (PDF). Our team placed 7th out of 13 participating teams in the challenge.
