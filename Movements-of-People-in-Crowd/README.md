This project was conducted as part of the "Modeling Seminar" course during my Master's studies.

A team of six students were tasked to analyze a scientific paper regarding the movements of individuals in a crowd setting. The initial phase of the project involved a thorough review of the paper and the preparation of a summary report. Subsequently, the team implemented a numerical simulation using Python to model the evacuation process of a room, taking into account various probability distributions of pedestrian movement.
