This project was conducted as part of the "Network Science" course during my Master's studies.

The aim of the project was to gain an understanding of several centrality measures and implement them in Python. These measures included eigenvector in-centrality, eigenvector out-centrality, Katz centrality, Bonacich alpha centrality, (alpha,beta)-centrality, HITS algorithm (also known as Hubs and Authorities) and the PageRank algorithm. The proposed algorithms were analyzed and evaluated on a temporal network dataset.
