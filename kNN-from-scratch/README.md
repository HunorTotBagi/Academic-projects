This project was undertaken as part of the "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" course during my Master's studies. The objectives of the project were:

To generate random samples from a normal distribution with specified parameters and use them to create a density estimator.
To investigate the effect of varying the number of neighbors on the accuracy of the density estimation by testing the estimator on different sample sizes.
To classify a randomly selected sample according to predefined labels.
