This project was undertaken as part of the "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" course during my Master's studies. The objectives of the project were:

1. To generate random samples from a normal distribution with specified parameters and use them to create a density estimator.
2. To investigate the effect of varying the number of neighbors on the accuracy of the density estimation by testing the estimator on different sample sizes.
3. To classify a randomly selected sample according to predefined labels.
