This project was a part of the "Introduction to Image Processing" course during my Master's studies. 

The objective of the project was to develop a method for accurately identifying the location of wheat heads in aerial images of wheat fields. The approach involved manually annotating a set of training images to create ground truth labels, which were then used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The trained model was then used to predict the location of wheat heads in new images. Additionally, we developed an algorithm for counting the number of wheat heads in the predicted images, which was used to evaluate the performance of the model.
