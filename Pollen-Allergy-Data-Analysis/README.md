This project was undertaken as part of the Programming for Data Science course during my Master's studies. The objectives of the project were:

1. To conduct a frequency analysis of the data entries for each user, and present the results in the form of histograms.
2. To analyze the temporal distribution of data entries and unique user counts, and present the results graphically.
3. To assess the correlation between various symptoms in the dataset.
4. To utilize boxplots to illustrate the overall distribution of symptoms on a monthly basis.
5. To examine daily variations in pollen levels.
6. To evaluate the relationship between pollen levels and seasons using Spearman correlation analysis.
