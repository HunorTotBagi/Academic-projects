This project was undertaken as part of the "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" course during my Master's studies. The objectives of the project were:

1. To implement the Random Forest algorithm from scratch.
2. To utilize the algorithm to estimate missing output values in a given dataset.
3. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm by varying the number of trees in the forest and the number of samples per leaf, and comparing the results to those obtained using the inbuilt Random Forest function in the scikit-learn library.
4. To prepare a concise presentation on the functioning of the algorithm and to present the results obtained.
